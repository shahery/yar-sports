# Deployment
 This project was deployed using the code institute's mock terminal for heroku.
   * Steps for deployment:
     * Create the env.py file, requirements.txt file and Procfile in the github for the
       project you want to deploy
     * Make it sure, you dont leave any empty newline in the Procfile
     * Create a new heroku app
     * Click on the resources in the heroku and add heroku postgres database for the project
     * Heroku postgres will create the database_url in the config vars, just copy that and 
       paste in the env.py file of your project in the github.
     * If you are using the cloudinary for your project then you will have to copy
       the cloudinary_url and paste in the env.py file same like database_url.
     * In the config vars, you have to create the Port: 8000 and secret key for your project
       and also copy and paste that secret key in env.py file of your project
     * After all this done, click on the deploy tab and connect your repository you want to 
       deploy with the heroku and click on the deploy branch
