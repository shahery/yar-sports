# Testing

 ## Manual python testing
  * Python code was tested to ensure that it met [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) style guidelines. This was done within    the terminal console using the command python3 -m flake8, which displayed errors and warnings within the code. Almost 54 errors were removed to meet the requirements of PEP8 style guidlines. The autogenerated warnings are:

   * Linting Issue: Line too long in settings.py file.
   * Linting Issue: Webhook and validator errors with e being assigned but never used.
   * Linting Issue: Importing checkout.signals in the checkout.apps.py file.
   * Most of these errors are auto created lines so adjusting these lines could create the problems in website.

   ![flake8-correction](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95220937/188011428-94e3ab3f-519d-492b-a5ea-ed004cf652c9.png)

 ## Automated python testing
   Automated tests for python were undertaken to check the functioning of the codes and it were all passed.Any testing that was not conducted using automated testing was done manually to ensure that site was fully functional upon deployment. Below is the screenshot 
   of automated tests that were performed for all the apps using the code 'python3 manage.py test' and we can also test all the apps 
   one by one using the code 'python3 manage.py test appname'.

  ![python-testing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95220937/188289408-6ff3c8e0-b330-4ca2-99ea-67d2b819c85c.png)

 ## Validator Testing
   I have manually tested this project by doing the following:
   * Passed the code through different validator checker and confirmed that there are no problems
   * Html checker:
     * I have checked all the html templates throughout the website and no errors were returned from [W3C Html](https://validator.w3.org/)

 ## Search Engine Optimization:
 * The site was optimized by careful selection of keywords. The following steps were taken to do this:

 * The entire table keywords consists of important relevant topics based upon my initial understanding of the business.
 * Using these topics a 'brain dump' of keywords was made orientated around common topics and themes within the business.
 * Topics and keywords were then tried out on Google and the relevant suggestions it gave were added to the keyword list.
 * Words crossed out were removed due to the lack of relevance and not being specific to the site
   and also having too much competition using [Wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/).
 * Words in blue denote the sites "Short Tail Keywords"
 * Words in Green denote the sites "Long Tail Keywords"

 * An example of how these words were used throughout the site can be seen below in the screenshot found on the websites homepage:
 
   ![SEO3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95220937/190006470-c896c8aa-6a41-47e5-b8d1-7fc962bc9402.png)

 ## SEO Implementations in HTML:
 * Words/phrases included within semantic HTML elements were optimized using the keywords above.
 * Careful consideration was given to the words chosen to avoid 'keyword stuffing'.
 * Keywords were used within links, urls and aria labels.
 * Social network links include rel="noopener" to not affect the assessment of the webpage.
 * Image description alt tags contain the keywords chosen above.
 * External reliable link was included within the site to improve SEO, this include:
   * Charities that the company supports.
   * Recommended Sports website.
 * Within the META data.

 ## Improving Google Metrics:
   Google metrics were considered when developing the site, including:
   * Click Through Rate (CTR):
     * The title and Meta data of the website were optimized with both short and long tailed keywords. Keywords selection
     is explained in the SEO section.
   * Bounce Rate:
     * The homepage of the site has been made engaging for the users. In fact, all the pages made are user friendly and interesting.
   * Dwell Time:
     * Content on the homepage is interesting and engaging to the users. Content was choosen relevent for the site.
   * Session Time:
     * It is made easy for the users to discover more content and products quickly through the search bar on the page.
   * Pages Per Session:
     * Links were regularly included throughout the website to encourage users to navigate through the website more and engage with more of the content quickly and easily.
   * Most importantly everything in the site was included by taking into consideration Expertise, Authoritativeness and
   Trustworthiness for improving the google metrics.


 ## Sitemap.xml:
  The sitemap was made to list the websites important url's to make sure that search engine spiders are able to easily crawl through the site and understand its structure. This was made using XML-sitemaps.com using the following steps:

  * Paste the URL of the deployed site into XML-sitemaps.
  * Download the XML sitemap file.
  * Drag and drop this file into the project root directory and ensure it is labelled sitemap.xml


 ## robots.txt:
  The robots.txt file was created to tell the search engine spiders that where they are not to allowed to go on the site and increase the quality of the site and improving the SEO rating. The following steps were taken to create this file:

  * File was added namely robots.txt.
  * The following code is written into this file, adding in your personalised sitemap url:
    * User-agent: *
    * Disallow:
    * Sitemap: YOUR_SITEMAP_URL
  * The final steps for working with these two files requires a DNS certificate for a deployed custom domain. This project did not require a custom domain and so it has been temporarily left out.
