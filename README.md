# Testing

 ## Manual python testing
  * Python code was tested to ensure that it met [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) style guidelines. This was done within    the terminal console using the command python3 -m flake8, which displayed errors and warnings within the code. Almost 54 errors were removed to meet the requirements of PEP8 style guidlines. The autogenerated warnings are:

   * Linting Issue: Line too long in settings.py file.
   * Linting Issue: Webhook and validator errors with e being assigned but never used.
   * Linting Issue: Importing checkout.signals in the checkout.apps.py file.
   * Most of these errors are auto created lines so adjusting these lines could create the problems in website.

   ![flake8-correction](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95220937/188011428-94e3ab3f-519d-492b-a5ea-ed004cf652c9.png)

 ## Automated python testing
   * Automated tests for python were undertaken to check the functioning of the codes and it were all passed.Any testing that was not conducted using automated testing was done manually to ensure that site was fully functional upon deployment. Below is the screenshot 
   of automated tests that were performed for all the apps using the code 'python3 manage.py test' and we can also test all the apps 
   one by one using the code 'python3 manage.py test appname'.

  ![python-testing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95220937/188289408-6ff3c8e0-b330-4ca2-99ea-67d2b819c85c.png)

 ## Validator Testing
   I have manually tested this project by doing the following:
   * Passed the code through different validator checker and confirmed that there are no problems
   * Html checker:
     * I have checked all the html templates throughout the website and no errors were returned from [W3C Html](https://validator.w3.org/)

        }
       main {

 ## Search Engine Optimization:
 * The site was optimized by careful selection of keywords. The following steps were taken to do this:

 * The entire table keywords consists of important relevant topics based upon my initial understanding of the business.
 * Using these topics a 'brain dump' of keywords was made orientated around common topics and themes within the business.
 * Topics and keywords were then tried out on Google and the relevant suggestions it gave were added to the keyword list.
 * Words crossed out were removed due to the lack of relevance and not being specific to the site
   and also having too much competition using [Wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/).
 * Words in blue denote the sites "Short Tail Keywords"
 * Words in Green denote the sites "Long Tail Keywords"
