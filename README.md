 ## Features left to implement

  
# Testing
 ## Python and Javascript Testing:
  * automated tests for python and javascript were undertaken to check the functioning of the codes and it were all passed.
  ![Python-test]
  ![js-test]
  * Flake8:
  * Almost 54 errors were removed according to the requirements of flake8
  * There are still few errors remaining like pylint error and line too long errors in few files like migrations and settings.py etc,
   I think most of them are auto created lines so adjusting these lines could create the problems in website.

# Deployment
 This project was deployed using the code institute's mock terminal for heroku.
   * Steps for deployment:
     * Create the env.py file, requirements.txt file and Procfile in the github for the
       project you want to deploy
     * Make it sure, you dont leave any empty newline in the Procfile
     * Create a new heroku app
     * Click on the resources in the heroku and add heroku postgres database for the project
     * Heroku postgres will create the database_url in the config vars, just copy that and 
       paste in the env.py file of your project in the github.
     * If you are using the cloudinary for your project then you will have to copy
       the cloudinary_url and paste in the env.py file same like database_url.
     * In the config vars, you have to create the Port: 8000 and secret key for your project
       and also copy and paste that secret key in env.py file of your project
